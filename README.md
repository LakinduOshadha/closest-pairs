# closest-pairs
Closest-Pair finds the Closest Pairs of an given array

Closest Pair (in one dimension)

The Closest Pair program, given an array a[ ] of N double values, finds closest pair(s): two values whose 
difference is not greater than the difference of any other pair (in absolute value).

2.1. Write a non-recursive algorithm for the Closest Pair program.
2.2. Analyze the runtime of the above algorithm.2.3. Implement your algorithm using Java which takes one dimensional double array as user input and 
displays the correct output.

Test case: 
 Input: [-5, 9, -3, -2, 0, 1, 10] 
 Output: (-3, -2), (0, 1) and (9, 10)
